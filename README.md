# IGVC_UI

A dynamic, user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring autonomous vehicle scripts and configurations.



## 🧠 Overview

**IGVC_UI** is a Qt-based GUI developed for the IGVC (Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition) stack under Abhiyaan, IIT Madras. It enables users to:

- Launch and monitor multiple ROS-based scripts directly through GUI
- Configure parameters from YAML/JSON files
- View terminal outputs in real-time
- Interact with checkboxes mapped to script toggles
- Automatically handle user config files
- Customize parameters through sliders and dropdowns
